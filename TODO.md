# Plugin ideas

- trim
- autosave
- tutorial
- selection / file picker API
- `fzf` based picker
- `E`, `R` commands as variants of lowercase commands using a file picker
- undo history as `U` using a picker

# Other

- Somehow guard against `Ctrl-C Ctrl-C` readline-induced program closing?
- Proper API for buffer lines
- More efficient undo history format

# Someday / Maybe

- Linked list based buffer for better performance
- proper tab handling?
- readline replacement?
- language-specific (LSP?)
