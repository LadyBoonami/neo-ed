# Missing POSIX ed commands

- `g/<pattern>/<command>`: global command.
  Needs sorting out of undo point logic first, otherwise this command generates a heap of undo points.
- Marks?
- Print commands `l`, `n`, `p`?
- `m<line>`: move lines, `t<line>`: copy lines
- `r`: read file or command

# Other core functionality

- replace tabs with spaces
- proper tab handling?
- readline replacement?

# Plugin ideas

- language-specific
- trim
- autosave
