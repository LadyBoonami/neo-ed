# Plugin ideas

- replace tabs with spaces
- trim
- autosave
- tutorial
- `fzf` based file selection helper as `R`
- undo history as `U`

# Other

- Somehow guard against `Ctrl-C Ctrl-C` readline-induced program closing?
- Don't auto-print files when opening, instead print current file after loading in `state` constructor and `e` command

# Someday / Maybe

- proper tab handling?
- readline replacement?
- language-specific (LSP?)
