# Necessary Fixes

- Test everything
- Fix global command

# Plugin ideas

- trim

# Other

- Rework implicit addressing
- Rework focus command(s) (f = place cursor and focus according to screen, F = place focus explicitly)
- API documentation
- Don't write file diff to disk on every change
- Implement `l` properly (not as an alias for default print)

# Someday / Maybe

- proper tab handling?
- readline replacement?
- language-specific (LSP?)
- Somehow guard against `Ctrl-C Ctrl-C` readline-induced program closing?
