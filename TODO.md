# Plugin ideas

- trim
- autosave
- tutorial

# Other

- API documentation
- Implement `l` properly (not as an alias for default print)

# Someday / Maybe

- proper tab handling?
- readline replacement?
- language-specific (LSP?)
- Somehow guard against `Ctrl-C Ctrl-C` readline-induced program closing?
